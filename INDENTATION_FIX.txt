INDENTATION FIX INSTRUCTIONS
================================

The file has a syntax error due to incorrect indentation after restructuring the layout.

QUICK FIX IN VS CODE:
1. Open add_question_screen.dart
2. Go to line 653 (// Conditional UI based on question type)
3. Select from line 653 to line 1025 (all the conditional UI code)
4. Press TAB once to add one level of indentation
5. Save the file

This will fix all the remaining indentation issues at once.

The error occurs because these lines need to be nested inside the Column widget's children array.
