Please check the browser console for these specific messages:

1. Look for: "🎮 SequenceBuilderWidget._initializeGame()"
2. Look for: "Options type:" and "Options value:"
3. Look for: "ERROR: Sequence Builder question has null options"
4. Look for: "Sequence Builder initialized: X sentences"

Copy and paste ALL the console output that appears after you click on the sequence builder question.

This will help me understand if:
- The options data is null (old question)
- The options data is present but in wrong format
- The widget is crashing for another reason
